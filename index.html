    <h1>The low-down about me</h1>

    <section>
      <p>
        <br> A little bit abut me....I spent 12 years in the military. 6 Navy and Army. I was lucky to have the
        opportunity to do and experience a lot of different jobs and learned skills. I have three children. All boys.
        They live with their mom in Spokane and they are 14, 10, 8.

        I was born in Peru. Then lived in California, Now Washington.
        I started my own Coffee company I started it mid-pandemic.
        It's always a work in progress.

        I got into computers back in 1994, I used to build them, I played around with hyper terminal and built some
        phreak
        boxes. I also Installed programs.

        In the Navy I was a Gas Turbine electrical tech, and I was also part of the ships first responder fire
        fighting team. I used to be on helicopter "crash and salvage" fire fighting flight deck team. In the Army I was
        Military Police, and a few other things, from communications, networking, mechanics, watercraft, etc.

        On the civilian side I've worked as a Power plant operator, field service diesel generator technician, I've
        been a field service engineer in the process industry, working with Programmable logic controllers, and
        robotics.
        I did a lot of automation, and learn something about programming. Learned A LOT about LOGIC.
