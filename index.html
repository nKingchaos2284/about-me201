    <p><br>A little bit abut me....I spent 12 years in the military. 6 Navy and Army. I was lucky to have the
      opportunity to do and experience a lot of different jobs and learned skills. I have three children. All boys. They
      live with their mom in Spokane and they are 14, 10, 8.</br></p>


    <p><br> I was born in Peru. Then lived in California, Now Washington. I started my own Coffee company I started it
      mid-pandemic. It's
      always a work in progress.
      I got into computers back in 1994, I used to build them, I played around with hyper terminal and built some phreak
      boxes. I also Installed programs.</br></p>

    <p> In the Navy I was a Gas Turbine electrical tech, and I was also part of the ships first responder fire fighting
      team. I used to be on helicopter "crash and salvage" fire fighting flight deck team. In the Army I was Military
      Police, and a few other things, from comms, networking, mechanics, watercraft, etc.</p>

    <p><br>On the civilian side I've worked as a Power plant operator, field service diesel generator tehnician, I've been a
      field service engineer in the process industry, working with Programmable logic controllers, and robotics. I did a
      lot of automation, and learn something about programming. Learned A LOT about LOGIC.
